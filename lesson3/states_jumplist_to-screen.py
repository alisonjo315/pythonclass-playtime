# Challenge Level: Beginner

# Background: You have a text file with all of the US state names:
#       states.txt: See section_07_(files).  
#
#       You also have a spreadsheet in comma separated value (CSV) format, state_info.csv.  See also section_07_(files)
#       state_info.csv has the following columns: Population Rank, State Name, Population, US House Members, Percent of US Population

# Challenge 1: Open states.txt and use the information to generate an HTML drop-down menu as in: https://github.com/shannonturner/python-lessons/blob/master/playtime/lesson02_states.py

# Step 1: Define your list of states
# These should all be strings, since they're names of places

with open('../../repo/section_07_(files)/states.csv','r') as states_file:
    states = states_file.read().split('\n')

# Step 2: Create your loop

print '<select>' 

for index,state in enumerate(states):
    states[index] = states[index].split(',')

    print '<option value="{0}">{1}</option>'.format(states[index][0],states[index][1])

print '</select>'

# Challenge 2: Save the HTML as states.html instead of printing it to screen.  
# Your states.html should look identical (or at least similar) to the one you created in the Lesson 2 playtime, except you're getting the states from a file instead of a list.
# see ./states_jumplist_to-html.py

# Challenge 3: Using state_info.csv, create an HTML page that has a table for *each* state with all of the state details.

# Sample output:

# <table border="1">
# <tr>
# <td colspan="2"> California </td>
# </tr>
# <tr>
# <td> Rank: 1 </td>
# <td> Percent: 11.91% </td>
# </tr>
# <tr>
# <td> US House Members: 53 </td>
# <td> Population: 38,332,521 </td>
# </tr>
# </table>

# Challenge 4 (Not a Python challenge, but an HTML/Javascript challenge): When you make a choice from the drop-down menu, jump to that state's table.

# Goal: Create a program that prints out an HTML drop down menu for all 50 states
